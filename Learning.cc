/* C++ Variables

int - stores integers (whole numbers), without decimals, such as 123 or -123

double - stores floating point numbers, with decimals, such as 19.99 or -19.99

char - stores single characters, such as 'a' or 'B'. Char values are surrounded by single quotes

string - stores text, such as "Hello World". String values are surrounded by double quotes

bool - stores values with two states: true or false

*/

/* Basic Data Types

bool	1 byte	Stores true or false values
char	1 byte	Stores a single character/letter/number, or ASCII values
int	2 or 4 bytes	Stores whole numbers, without decimals
float	4 bytes	Stores fractional numbers, containing one or more decimals. Sufficient for storing 6-7 decimal digits
double	8 bytes	Stores fractional numbers, containing one or more decimals. Sufficient for storing 15 decimal digits

When you do not want others (or yourself) to change existing variable values,
use the const keyword (this will declare the variable as "constant",

/* Good To Know

cout is pronounced "see-out". Used for output, and uses the insertion operator (<<)

cin is pronounced "see-in". Used for input, and uses the extraction operator (>>)
