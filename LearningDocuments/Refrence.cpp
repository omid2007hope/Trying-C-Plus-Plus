    In the example from the previous page, the & operator was used to create a reference variable.
    But it can also be used to get the memory address of a variable;

    which is the location of where the variable is stored on the computer.

    When a variable is created in C++, a memory address is assigned to the variable.

    And when we assign a value to the variable, it is stored in this memory address.

    To access it, use the & operator, and the result will represent where the variable is stored:
    */

    // ! Note: The memory address is in hexadecimal form (0x..). Note that you may not get the same result in your program.

    std::cout << &meal;
    /*
    And why is it useful to know the memory address?

    References and Pointers (which you will learn about in the next chapter) are important in C++,
    because they give you the ability to manipulate the data in the computer's memory
    - which can reduce the code and improve the performance.

    These two features are one of the things that make C++ stand out from other programming languages,
    like Python and Java.
